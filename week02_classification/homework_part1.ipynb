wiki . it is : oh , ah , oh-ah , ah-oh , ha , ho ( say it moderately fast ) . sine , cosine , tangent , cotangent , secant , cosecant are : o / h , a / h , oh / ah , ah / oh , h / a , h / o . unlike the soa-cah-toa nemonic it gives all six common functions . but i like to teach only the 1st three , oh , ah , oh-ah ( simple enough ) , or even only the first two , oh ah and have them ( students ) memorize only sin , cos , and tan then have them learn and understand that tan = sin / cos and the last three are inverses of the 1st three . it might sound a bit like a tongue twister at first , but it only took a my high school trig class about 15 minutes to learn it and a good part of that time was laughter and it is silly enough to be memorable . i still use it after 45 + years and some of my

hahaahahahahahahaha unblock me or i will vandalise more ! ! ! it had been six years since we had graduated from college , and for the first time since graduation , all three of us were together again . from the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home , it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact , the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable . having returned to my cozy , semi-secluded home in the suburbs , we all sat in the living room , sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives . with the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol , it could have been any of our final two years of college together : the three of us , tight-knit friends-with-benefits , sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together . then , justine and beth had been roommates while i lived in another dorm across the main quad ; now , they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend . as i sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine , i allowed my eyes to truly linger on justine as she told beth about a recent situation at work . the florida sun had certainly added a glow to justine\\'s skin , and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair . as when we were in college together , she wore virtually no make-up , just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor , as i had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails . her red dress was indeed elegant , with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage , a display which beth and i both certainly appreciated . the long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt , one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh . the red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes . surprisingly , however , she wore hoop earrings , something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe . the conversation turned back toward me , but a few minutes later , the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other . i took the opportunity to once again study beth , and was equally impressed . while noticeably shorter than justine , beth was also paler in complexion , a testament to living in northern canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research . as in college , beth preferred the color black for her outfits : a somewhat-tight sweater , form-fitting slacks , and a pair of low heels . four tiny earrings adorned each ear , plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril . beth\\'s black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front , and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to justine . it felt so good to be in their presence once again . especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college , i was thankful that i had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me . i had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy , but for now , i was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa . the intimacy began when we finally went to bed ... together . i was on my back under the covers , with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder . an arm wrapped around each of them , i held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest , dipped a finger into my navel , brushed my thighs through the sweatpants i typically wore to bed , caressed my stiffening manhood . my eyes closed , i reveled in their touches : inherently familiar , yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time . no words were needed . and as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me , i smiled to myself in the darkness , having always enjoyed watching beth and justine in their own intimate encounters . but eventually , their touches slowed and ultimately ceased , their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep . i stayed awake a little longer , immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life . i awoke in the morning to the scent of french roast coffee , faint yet unmistakable . justine was gone , clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar , while beth and i held each other as sh',\n       \"i've gone ahead and created the stub article : march

should facts should be added about aig loan in that , the preceding days before this loan was arranged , timothy geitner , president of ny fed , had announced and published in nyc newspapers that he would not make this loan as aig had been asking for a loan of 35 - 40 billion from the fed res for a week . and that public request resulted in the timonthy geitner refusal to loan aig anything . then , geitner , paulson and bernake were all 3 informed of the 100s of billions in mortgage insurance that aig had issued and also the trillions in derivatives insurance that aig had issued and informed of the further clear conclusions that ... without supporting the aig loan and allowing aig to fail , this massive amount of market related insurance would cause a global market collapse . this info did not come from aig but from private party to these three , paulson , bernanke and geitner who had no knowledge of aig\\'s importance to markets . and today making that aig loan is credited with saving the global markets from collapse . but that occurred as just explained and not from any knowledge of bernanke , paulson or geitner but from advice of outside party that reversed the already refusal by the fed to loan aig anything as announced publicly by gietner . ( so that outside party is one who saved markets from collapse - not geitner , bernanke , paulson ) this lack of market knowledge by all three , paulson , geitner , and bernanke , is important to understand in understanding depth of market understanding in current proposals to allow us treasury to dictate systemic risk decision , when no one at the us treasury , other than saying those words , has shown any knowledge of markets to be able to determine what that is . / s / harvey keitel , markit bon vivant jr 69.121 . 221.97 iq & markets in the iq discussion in the article it is touted that the bernanke has a higher iq and that qualified him for his job . also it has been mentioned that he is an expert in depression era events . neither worked to have bernanke act appropriately in this global crisis which he / bernanke caused via fighting the spike in oil and gold prices and his efforts directly caused this crisis . so that with bernanke\\'s higher iq did not have him perceive what he was doing would cause a near global market meltdown and his studies of the depression era did not clue him in not to cause nearly a depression . / s too true ioq ix 69.121 . 221.97 demonizing wall street for us government caused crisis in the bubble , all agree was caused by greenspan , and in the huge push to give mortgages to those non qualified which all agree was caused by fannie mae , etc and by congress , this directly lead to the subprime debacle and beginning of the global crisis - none of which was caused by wall street . then in the fight by bernanke to stop the projected inflation caused by oil & gold spikes , his actions massively slammed the overall economy which was perking along just fine even with the subprime debaclev which was a smaller part of the usa $ 15 trillion economy . next , massive jaw boning of the huge crisis was done by paulson to get funds and that caused the coup de grace , the huge retrenchment of all spending by consumers ... all these events were not caused by wall street then paulson , bernanke and later hugely obama and congress , again and again bad mouthed again and again wall street claiming that this whole series of events was caused by wall street when it was mainly caused by the us governement and aided by consumer spending retrenchment but congres and the pundits caused the us population to believe the lie it was wall street\\'s fault due to gambling . all distortion 100 % . destruction of capital formation and wall street one of the key features of bernanke\\'s job in oversight for the usa economy is in also protecting capital formation ... and the engine of economic growth in the usa for 300 years has been the usa efficient capital distribution to new ventures , old ventures , etc and the recent sequence of bad mouthing by all concerned of wall street publicly now and including esp the talking heads on cnn and esp cnbc has severely damaged that core of the reason for usa dominance and leadership for those 300 years . added to that huge destruction is the special refusal by all of the us government to identify and prosecute the huge fraudulent short selling of all major wall street firms and major usa banks which was fraudulent esp as done in a intentional and ever increasing crecend',\n       '\" the future of the article i stripped the article to the bones last night , after an edit conflict with the apparent representation for mr . elias which lead to the account for being temporarily blocked from editing . all information of biographies of living persons must be sourced by reliable sources . reliable sources are not his myspace , the word of his label , blogs , or any other such website . this is not a negotiable policy , you cannot base an encyclopedic article on intimate knowledge . there is no flexibility to the issue . additionally , the article is not to serve as a promotional work and may not be filled with puff and cushion . this is not negotiable . the management and artist are best served to leave the article alone at this time , until wikipedia policies and guidelines can be both applied and followed . this is all spoken with the admin hat on . talk \"',\n       'stay in the closet .',\n       \"i have no life , and if i don't get to ever have sex then i will make everyone's life i can as miserable as possible !\",\n       \"hey can you please stop it bugs me when some one does that edit a page i did . i know i'm not right all the time but what the fuck that wwe 2k15 roster has been confirmed so stop bugging me and don't threat me stupid bitch if you don't like it get the fuck out i'm sure you've annoyed many people case of incorrect info . so shut the fuck up if you can't handle it fuck out !

all the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new anti-semitism i . e . coming from the left , related to radical anti-zionism etc . ( talk ) they may well be , but they are not sourced that way . i don\\'t think we can expect the words \" \" new anti-semitism \" \" to appear in every single report we reference . we\\'ve defined it , and we\\'ve linked to many sources who are defining it . the definition is : it is a form of judenhass that emanates from the left . it is characterized by the demonization of the world\\'s only jewish state and of jews as an ethnicity and a religion . israel\\'s right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied . the jewish people\\'s right of self-determination is denied . double standards are applied , whereby the actions of the jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her . jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the jewish state . symbols and images associated with classic anti-semitism are used : for example , blood libels are resurrected , the jewish state and jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving jews or zionists or israelis plotting to take over the world , or being in control of other governments , or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others . arab and islamic anti-semitism are excused and ignored . straw-man attacks are made , whereby jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of israel is anti-semitism , and that is then used to condemn jewish groups as unreasonable , and to deny that there is any such thing as the \" \" new anti-semitism . \" \" all of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against jews and their synagogues and schools , particularly in europe . it is found in conjunction with anti-americanism ( because jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the american government ) , anti-zionism , and the anti-globalization movement . all the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components , so when we find them , we can offer them as examples , so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-semitism or attacks on jews . ( talk ) my worry is that livingstone has not been ( at least in the sources provided ) accused of anti-semitism , and that most of the discussion of galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters . add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism ( not reporting others allegations ) , which is or ( and unwise in the case of galloway ) . the nus thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so i\\'d just want to tidy that up . livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-semitism ( got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it ) , as has galloway , and without question his supporters . the section talks about it in relation to that election . by all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit , and we can talk later if there are any disagreements .
